  link: https://cadforassurance.org/tools/design-for-trust/analysis-of-security-of-split-manufacturing-using-machine-learning/
  description:  This project is on studying the security of chip fabrication by an untrusted foundry. The fabrication technique, known as split manufacturing, is based on partial sharing of the chip design information with the untrusted foundry in order to protect the intellectual property of the chip.

- title: GR-DR
  subtitle: bridging the gap between GR and DR
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: This project aims to develop CAD tools that incorporate major design rules within a key, higher stage of the design flow, namely the global routing stage with the aim to bridge the gap with the lower detailed routing stage.
  
- title: PostSiDebug
  subtitle: post-Si debug of timing errors
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: Timing errors refer to those malfunctions which manifest in the form of setup and hold time violations on logic. The objective of this research is to bring automation to the debug process of timing errors. Our vision is to rely on few on-chip measurements to bring valuable information about the internal timing characteristics of the chip.

- title: GRCongestion
  subtitle: congestion analysis for GR
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: In modern IC designs, several new factors contribute to routing congestion including significantly different wire size and spacing among the metal layers, sizes of inter-layer vias, local congestion due to pin density and wiring inside a global-cell. This research aims to develop techniques for fast congestion analysis at global routing to increase correlation with detailed routing.

- title: Parallel GR
  subtitle: parallel global routing
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: With the aid of large-scale parallelism provided by computational grids, the research aims to demonstrate that the use of a computational technique called integer programming, which was previously viewed as too time-consuming for global routing, can help generate significantly higher quality solutions while meeting practical runtime requirements. 

- title: CAD4Variability
  subtitle: design automation with manufacturing-induced variations
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: In modern IC design, smaller components are less tolerant to manufacturing-induced variations; their performance may turn out so poor that the IC may have to be entirely redesigned in order to meet the performance specs. This research aims to develop a framework for producing IC designs that are robust with respect to imperfections.
