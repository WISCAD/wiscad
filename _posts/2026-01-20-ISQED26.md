title: New paper on transformer-based Hardware Trojan detection
---

Our new work, BERT-HIT, is a transformer-based framework that directly analyzes gate-level netlists as text for Hardware Trojan detection. Consequently, it removes the need for manual feature engineering. By modeling netlists as natural language, the approach captures rich contextual dependencies among circuit elements.
