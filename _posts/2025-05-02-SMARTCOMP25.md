New paper "FreDDI: Frequency-Driven DNN Partitioning in Distributed Inference" accepted to appear in proceedings of SMARTCOMP'25. The work formulates distributed inference in deep neural networks (DNNs) when considering frequency selection of an edge/hub/cloud device as an additional knob of control which can impact the global latency and/or energy. Congratulations to first and only student author [Robert Viramontes](https://wiscad.github.io/wiscad/members/robert-viramontes.html)!
