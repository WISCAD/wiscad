# Computers that Make Computers

At the WISCAD lab, we develop computer-aided design tools for Integrated Circuits (ICs). Our research sits right in between computer science and electrical engineering. We develop models, algorithms, and software for designing ICs.  This includes all aspects such as support for scalability for handling billions of components in a chip, emerging devices and technologies, heteregenous integration, domain-specific platforms such as machine learning accelerators, and secure design and validation of ICs.

We use machine learning to improve computer-aided design and its explainability for Integrated Circuits. We also design software for efficient implementation of machine learning algorithms on hardware platforms such as resource-constrained edge devices. See what we have published.
