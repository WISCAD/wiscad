At the WISCAD lab, we develop computer-aided design (CAD) tools for Integrated Circuits (ICs). Our research sits in between computer science and electrical engineering. We develop models, algorithms, and software for designing ICs.  This includes all aspects such as generating layout of billions of components on a chip, emerging devices and technologies, heteregenous integration, use of machine learning for better chip design, and secure design and validation of ICs.
