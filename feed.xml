This work explores distributing inference across a source and a partner edge device connected to different power grids, aiming to minimize the overall carbon footprint. It introduces a carbon footprint model for distributed inference that integrates computation, communication, and the hold time of partnering edge devices. An optimization formulation is proposed to determine how inference tasks should be distributed across these devices based on the carbon footprint model.

Neural networks are used to reduce the number of backtracks when searching the decision tree of test patterns, and reduce the runtime of ATPG. Our results show neural networks are not effective if applied for backtracing in circuit nodes which are too close to, or too far away from, the inputs.
