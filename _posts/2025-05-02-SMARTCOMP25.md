title: New Paper and Travel Award
---

New paper "FreDDI: Frequency-Driven DNN Partitioning in Distributed Inference" to appear in proceedings of SMARTCOMP'25. This work formulates distributed inference in deep neural networks (DNNs) when considering frequency selection of an edge/hub/cloud device as an additional knob of control which can impact the global latency and/or energy. Congratulations to first and only student author [Robert Viramontes](https://wiscad.github.io/wiscad/members/robert-viramontes.html)! He has also received a $1600 NSF travel award to present his work at Cork Ireland, June 16-19.
