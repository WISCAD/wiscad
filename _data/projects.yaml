- title: GR-DR
  subtitle: bridging GR to DR
  link: https://github.com/WISCAD/TRAPL/  
  image: images/trapl.jpg
  description: This project aims to develop CAD tools that incorporate major design rules within a key, higher stage of the design flow, namely the global routing stage with the aim to bridge the gap with the lower detailed routing stage.

- title: GRCongestion
  subtitle: congestion analysis for GR
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: In modern IC designs, several new factors contribute to routing congestion including significantly different wire size and spacing among the metal layers, sizes of inter-layer vias, local congestion due to pin density and wiring inside a global-cell. This research aims to develop techniques for fast congestion analysis at global routing to increase correlation with detailed routing.

- title: Parallel GR
  subtitle: parallel global routing
  image: images/pgrip.jpg
  description: With the aid of large-scale parallelism provided by computational grids, the research aims to demonstrate that the use of a computational technique called integer programming, which was previously viewed as too time-consuming for global routing, can help generate significantly higher quality solutions while meeting practical runtime requirements.

- title: CAD4Variability
  subtitle: design automation with manufacturing-induced variations
  image: images/photo.jpg
  description: In modern IC design, smaller components are less tolerant to manufacturing-induced variations; their performance may turn out so poor that the IC may have to be entirely redesigned in order to meet the performance specs. This research aims to develop a framework for producing IC designs that are robust with respect to imperfections.
