# Computers that Make Computers

At the WISCAD lab, we develop computer-aided design (CAD) tools for Integrated Circuits (ICs). Our research sits right in between computer science and electrical engineering. We develop models, algorithms, and software for designing ICs.  This includes all aspects such as support for billions of components in a chip, emerging devices and technologies, heteregenous integration, domain-specific platforms such as machine learning accelerators, and secure design and validation of ICs. In a broader sense, we are interested in applied algorithms and design automation of Things.
