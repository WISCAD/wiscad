This work explores distributing inference across a source and a partner edge device connected to different power grids, aiming to minimize the overall carbon footprint. It introduces a carbon footprint model for distributed inference that integrates computation, communication, and the hold time of partnering edge devices. An optimization formulation is proposed to determine how inference tasks should be distributed across these devices based on the carbon footprint model.

This paper discusses an effective way to encode a a gate-level circuit given in a Hardware Description Language to reverse engineer the higher-level words using Large Language Models. We combine different embedding schemes to encode circuit information to best be inferred by the BERT model. This includes a novel tree-based positional embedding scheme to encode the position of each gate within the graph structure of a circuit as a token sequence.
