# Computers that Build Computers

Our mission at the WISCAD lab is to develop software and algorithms for computer-aided design of Integrated Circuits. This includes all aspects such as support for emerging devices and technologies, packaging and fabrication, domain-specific platforms, and secure design and validation.

We use machine learning to improve computer-aided design and its explainability for Integrated Circuits. We also design software for efficient implementation of machine learning algorithms on hardware platforms such as resource-constrained edge devices. See what we have published.
