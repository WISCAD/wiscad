This paper discusses an effective way to encode a a gate-level circuit given in a Hardware Description Language to reverse engineer the higher-level words using Large Language Models. We combine different embedding schemes to encode circuit information to best be inferred by the BERT model. This includes a novel tree-based positional embedding scheme to encode the position of each gate within the graph structure of a circuit as a token sequence.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our paper titled “ReBERT: LLM for Gate-Level to Word-Level Reverse Engineering” has been nominated for best paper in DATE’2025.

Neural networks are used to reduce the number of backtracks when searching the decision tree of test patterns, and reduce the runtime of ATPG. Our results show neural networks are not effective if applied for backtracing in circuit nodes which are too close to, or too far away from, the inputs. We also propose a look-up technique to reuse previously-computed inferences to significantly accelerate the runtime. The neural network itself should not be too complex because of the associated inference overhead, and overall objective to reduce the runtime of ATPG.
