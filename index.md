# Computers that Make Computers

At the WISCAD lab, we develop software for computer-aided design of Integrated Circuits (ICs). Our research sits right in between computer science and electrical engineering. We develop algorithm and software for specific design problems encountered during the process of designing ICs.  This includes all aspects such as support for scalability for handling billions of components, emerging devices and technologies, heteregenous integration, domain-specific platforms such as machine learning accelerators, and secure design and validation of ICs.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We use machine learning to improve computer-aided design and its explainability for Integrated Circuits. We also design software for efficient implementation of machine learning algorithms on hardware platforms such as resource-constrained edge devices. See what we have published.
