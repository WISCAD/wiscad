title: Best Paper Candidate

Our paper titled "ReBERT: LLM for Gate-Level to Word-Level Reverse Engineering" has been nominated for best paper in [DATE'2025](https://www.date-conference.com/). Congratulations to first author [Lizi Zhang](https://wiscad.github.io/wiscad/members/lizi-zhang.html) and our industry collaborator Dr. Rasit Topaloglu. This paper discusses an effective way to encode a text file describing a gate-level circuit in a Hardware Description Language to be reverse engineer into bit-level using Large Language Models. We combine three embedding schemes to encode circuit information to best be understood by the standard BERT model. This includes a novel tree-based positional embedding scheme to encode the position of each gate within the graph structure of a circuit as a token sequence.
