title: New paper on Carbon-aware distributed inference
---
 
Our research project, CADI, was presented at [IEEE COINS](https://coinsconf.com/program-2/) in Madison, Wisconsin. This work explores distributing inference across a source and a partner edge device connected to different power grids, aiming to minimize the overall carbon footprint. It introduces a carbon footprint model for distributed inference that integrates computation, communication, and the hold time of partnering edge devices. An optimization formulation is proposed to determine how inference tasks should be distributed across these devices based on the carbon footprint model.
